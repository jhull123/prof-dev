## Tiny Complementary Projects (1–2 weeks each)
These add resume breadth.

| Project | What It Teaches |
| --- | --- |
| LangChain / LlamaIndex chatbot on custom documents | Practical RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) |
| Hugging Face Transformers fine-tune on a small dataset | Model tuning & evaluation |
| ML pipeline w/ FastAPI + Pydantic + Docker | MLOps + backend fluency |
| LLM-powered log parser for DevOps logs | Connects to your past career for instant relevance |
| “Fake reviews” detector (NLP classification) | Foundation model + prompt-based vs fine-tuned comparison |

Identify and execute 2–3 to balance Battle Hexes.

## Courses

| Course | Why Take It |
| --- | --- |
| DeepLearning.AI – ChatGPT Prompt Engineering (free) | Fast ROI, very practical for LLM use |
| Hugging Face Transformers Course (free) | Directly applies to modern LLM work |
| Fast.ai (free) | Great for learning practical deep learning in context |
| Full Stack Deep Learning | Understands the lifecycle of model dev to deployment |
| Coursera: Reinforcement Learning Specialization (David Silver) | Optional but high value if you’re RL-heavy |

Avoid overcommitting to long, academic-style ML certs unless they’re needed for a role (they often aren’t).
